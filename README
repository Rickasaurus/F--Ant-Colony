This is Richard Minerich's F# Ant Colony Silverlight/WPF Edition. This code is free to be used for anything you like as long as I am properly acknowledged.

Note that this was all hacked out with getting the most done in the least amount of time in mind.  The UI code is particularly bad.  You have been warned.

The basic Silverlight used here is based on Phillip Trelford's Missile Command Example

To open in Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft Silverlight 5 Tools for Visual Studio 2010 SP1 are required.

To compile the latest F# tools are required as they include F# Core for Silverlight 5.
