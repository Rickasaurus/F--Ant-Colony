// This is Richard Minerich's F# Ant Colony Silverlight Ediiton
// Visit my Blog at http://RichardMinerich.com
// This code is free to be used for anything you like as long as I am properly acknowledged.
//
// Note that this was all hacked out with getting the most done in the least amount of time in mind.  
// The UI code is particularly bad.  You have been warned. 
//
// The basic Silverlight used here is based on Phillip Trelford's Missile Command Example
